â€¢ Implement the Diagram:*Attacker -> BotNet: Issue attack command  
  The attacker sends a command to the BotNet to initiate a DDoS attack. 

*BotNet -> WebServer: Flood with requests  
  The BotNet begins sending massive amounts of traffic to the Web Server and causing service disruptions.

*WebServer -> Firewall: Alert: High traffic volume  
    The web server experiences an unusual traffic and alerts the firewall about the DDoS attack.

*Firewall -> WebServer: Traffic analysis  
    The firewall analyzes the incoming traffic to differentiate between legitimate and malicious traffic. 

*Firewall -> BotNet: Block malicious IPs  
    The firewall blocks IP addresses identified as being part of the attack.

*Firewall -> Attacker: Block command IP  
    The firewall detects and blocks the IP address of the attacker or the command server

*WebServer -> BotNet: Unable to respond  
    The firewall blocking malicious traffic, the web server stops responding to requests from the botNet.

BotNet -> Attacker: Attack partially failed    
   The BotNet reports back to the attacker that the attack was only partially successful because the firewall blocked many of the bot systems.  
Each step in the diagram demonstrates a critical phase in the DDoS attack:

Documentation:
    Attacker initiates the attack by sending a command to the BotNet.  
    BotNet follows the attack command by flooding the Web Server with an overwhelming number of requests.  
    The Web Server raises an alert to the Firewall, triggering defense mechanisms like traffic analysis and IP blocking.  
    The Firewall mitigates the attack by blocking the malicious traffic and preventing further commands from the Attacker.
